# Democracy NOW

Democracy NOW is an open-source project that
is centered on the principles of making democracies 
more accessible to the average voter. 
This project (will) take a data driven approach,
extracting data from various sources, 
compiling and analyzing it,
and allowing for voters to explore the law making process
to better express opinions about what is occurring 
in their country and democracy.

Currently, this project is run by Hunter Heidenreich
and is starting with compiling data about
the United States House of Representatives. 
 

This project is completely open-source and wishes to maintain 
maximal transparency.
It also wishes for any and all collaboration!

## Using Democracy NOW

More to come soon once noteworthy progress has been made!

## TODO 

This is where I'm placing items that still need to be done 
so that they aren't forgotten:

- Extracting more information from bills
- Transition repo fully to new representative objects 
- Better way of handling sessions and house in total
- Probably want a tool to initiate and seed downloads, 
with some user control via the command line.
- Saving URLs and filenames within objects for ease of updating 
information if user requests a refresh
